// Code your solutions in this file
function countDown(x){
let countup = x;
while (countup >= 0) {
  console.log(countup--);
}
}

function writeCards(x,y){
const out = [];
Would produce the following array:

```js
[
  "Thank you, Ada, for the wonderful birthday gift!",
  "Thank you, Brendan, for the wonderful birthday gift!",
  "Thank you, Ali, for the wonderful birthday gift!"
];
```
}
